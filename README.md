 <h1>Identifying Patients at Risk of Falling</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>

This project focuses on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify patients at risk of falling by extracting information from clinical notes. Accidental falls are preventable adverse events that can have a significant impact on patient outcomes, quality of life, and the risk of acute readmissions. This project aims to enhance patient safety by developing a model that analyzes clinical documents to detect fall risk factors.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

**Problem**: Accidental falls among older post-acute care (PAC) and Home Health patients are preventable but can have severe consequences.

**Objective**: Develop an NLP and ML model to identify patients at risk of falling by extracting relevant information from clinical notes.

<h2>Challenges</h2>

**Variability in Clinical Notes**: Clinical notes can vary significantly in content, format, and quality, making it challenging to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data.

**Context Understanding**: Understanding the context in which fall risk factors are mentioned in clinical notes is crucial for accurate risk assessment.

**Limited Labeled Data**: The project faces a challenge in obtaining a significant amount of labeled data for evaluation, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

**Accurate identification of patients at risk of falling can lead to**:

Improved patient outcomes
Enhanced quality of life
Reduced risk of acute readmissions
Cost savings through fewer complications and shorter hospital stays
